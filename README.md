# Weather-App

The goal of this project was to create a simple weather app using the open weather API. 

I used a promise chain to set up the requests without much issue and then plugged the results into DOM elements. 

It was an easy project overall, but a fun one. In the future I will test out using async/await over promise, and error catching.
